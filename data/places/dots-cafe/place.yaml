   We found this little charming coffee place in our way to find a different
   brunt spot that was actually closed, so we decided to come back and give it
   a  try.

   What a pleasant surprise, there is no doubt that Neukolln is becoming an
   amazing neighborhood to live in. The variety of places with affordable prices
   is overwelming, and the atmosphere is relaxing and welcoming. This place has
   some spots to sit outside which is perfect from spring to autum.

   We tried the **Savory James**, pancakes with bacon and the
   **Getruffeltes Ei im Glas**, eggs in a glass topped with grilled cheese. Both
   plates were very tasty, and there is also great coffee and wifi, which makes
   it also a great spot to come to do some work.

   We will defenitely be back to try some of the pastries they had inside.
