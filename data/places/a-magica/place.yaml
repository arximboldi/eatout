title: We may have found a new favorite pizza place
description: |
  Finding good pizza in Berlin is not hard.  This city is full of
  pizza shops, many of which even get the aproval even of our italian
  friends.  Yet *A Magica* managed to surprise us.  Rough, basic but
  very authentic and definitelly tasty pizzas are served in this
  little place in Prenzlauer Berg.  The place is small so it easily
  becomes full---and noisy!---so don't forget to make a reservation.
  Would repeat!
