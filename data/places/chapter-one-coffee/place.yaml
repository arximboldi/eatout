title: Coffee Masters in Kreuzberg
description: |
   Delicious coffee and nice pastries is what you can expect from this
   charming coffee place in Kreuzberg.  The coffee has an intense yet
   sharp flavour that makes it delicious--best without sugar.  The
   staff is very friendly and doesn't mind spending their time with
   you diving into the details of thir extense coffee selection,
   without the condescension that other rosteries use with those of us
   that are not coffee _connoisseurs_.

   Chapter One is located next to [Marheineke
   Markthalle](http://meine-markthalle.de/en/), and on saturdays there
   is a nice small *flea market* that is worth visiting since it is
   not as crowded and expensive as Mauer Park.  The coffee selection
   changes every week.  Recommended.
