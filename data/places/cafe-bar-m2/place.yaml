title: Also known as Hamburger Heaven
description: |
  This is a burguer shop run by the same people than the little street
  side imbis in Gräfestrasse, called Hamburger Heaven.  The place is
  one of the best burger places in Berlin.  Not only are the meat
  decent and the patties appropriate: the sauces---homemade ketchup
  and chilly mayo--- and the sides---fries out of Branderburger
  _kartoffeln_---are top notch, _creme the la creme_.

  For some reason, the bar never got to have the best atmosphere
  though, there was something that felt a bit souless about it.  Maybe
  that's the reason why it never got to have enough tracktion to keep
  a sustainable business in a street where rents are going up too
  fast.  R.I.P.
