title: The California Breakfast Slam
description: |
  The first thing that attracted us to this place is its funny and
  absurd, collage posters that flood the area of north Neukölln from
  time to time.  Their proposition is a combination of west coast
  inspired food, American diner sized portions and a relaxed
  atmosphere.

  I lived in California in the past and could not remember Californian
  breakfast being a thing, so I didn't know what to expect.  First
  time we went there on a busy day but they served us mimosas to
  successfully cheer us up.  However, overall we are left with mixed
  feelings about the place.  While their food is original, it is
  sometimes too fatty, big or expensive, and the taste is
  irregular---some dishes are quite good, some lacked salt or
  spiciness.  Some of the stuff is also clearly overpriced, like the
  tasteless 0.2cl lemonade.  We are divided and leave it open for you
  to judge.
