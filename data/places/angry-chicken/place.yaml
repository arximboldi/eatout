title: Korean style fried chicken
description: |
  This place is a small fast food shop from the same people that run
  [Kimchi Princess](kimchi-princess) around the corner.  With a
  similar colourful, bold and trendy branding, it blends Korean street
  food with western fast food.

  The offering is simple: deep fried chicken with increasing levels of
  *angryness*---read: hotness---with the exeption of the delicious
  *sexy* chicken, which is served on a soja-garlic sauce that is for
  sure stimulating.  On the side, the sweet potato chips definitelly
  stand out, with a crunchy touch that makes them even more addictive
  than usual.  They also do worthy Bibimbap and Burgers, both veggi
  and otherwise.  The perfect place to grab something quick and fatty
  on a hangovery sunday afternoon.
