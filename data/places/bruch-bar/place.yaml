title: 'Breakfast & Cocktail Bar'
description: |
  The northern area of Neuköln is for sure full of good places to have
  breakfast, and this is one of them.  The breakfast plate at Bruch
  is... voluptuous.  It has everything, from antipasti to decen wurst,
  eggs and salad with nice italian inspired _condimento_.  The place
  is cozy and nice in the way Berlin has made us used to: fleamarket
  furniture arranged with taste in between peeling walls.

  Both things---huge breakfast and nice atmosphere---might make one
  stay longer than she expected.  But that's no problem: a nice
  selection of cocktails can cheer you up as the sun goes down.
  Recommended: great place to go with friends with whom you have a lot
  to catch up with.
