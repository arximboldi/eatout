title: American hotdogs, Whiskey & Craft Beers
description: |
  Craft beer, fancy cocktails, lots of bourbon, and hotdogs.  That's
  the main offering of this tiny but cosy spot in Spreewaldplatz, next
  to Gorlitzer Platz, at the heart of the party part of Kreuzberg.

  While the drinks are good---although leaning towards the pricey
  side---I would totally not go there for the food.  The hotdogs are
  unimpressive.  While the toppings and sauce are *ok*, the sausage
  and bread are small and average and definitely not worth the 6 euros
  that they cost.  For half the price you may have a much more tasty
  _schawarma_ next door.  The place is maybe interesting as a
  anthropological curiosity: it is one good example of the hipster
  anglophone expat culture that is gentrifying Berlin.
