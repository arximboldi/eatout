title: Coffee roaster near Mauer Park
description: |
  Very close to Mauerpark, Bonanza is a small coffee shop.  Greeting
  us with its dark sky front and cursive neon light sign, the roaster
  opens to small but cosy caffe.

  They roast their own coffee and it shows: its fine selection is a
  delight for coffee lovers.  You can match the drink with some of
  their tasty pastries, open a book, and enjoy the afternoon.
