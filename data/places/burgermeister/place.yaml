title: Masters of the burger
description: |
  The Berlin burger scene is becoming overcrowded with hipster venues
  targeted at expats and tourists, that use contemporary design and
  posed cues from underground american cuture to distract us from the
  fact that we are paying too much for an average burger.  This is not
  the case in *Burgermeister*.

  While the place has become more crowded over the years---tourists
  are starting to pick it up, attracted by its well deserved
  reputation---it is still true to its spirit.  Situated in a former
  public toilet under the _U-8 Schlesisches Tor_ station, in the
  middle of the Berlin clubbing route, the place offers cheap quality
  burgers to the crowds of party people that pass by in the later ours
  of the night.  But any time of the day is a good time take your bike
  and ride to Burgermeister for some decent burger and nice german
  fries.

  While it is still possible to find better burgers in Berlin,
  Burgermeister stands out because of its authenticity and fair price.
  Our recommendation: the *Meisterburger* with fried onions, mustard,
  bacon and bbq sauce.  A must go.
