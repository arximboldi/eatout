  Where to go for lunch when your family is visiting? That was my problem while visiting
  one of the most touristy streets in Berlin Friedrichstra√üe, where you can find the finest
  galleries or shops. We found this restaurant, just in front of the ritter sport
  shop (that its worth a visit, you can create your own chocolate!).

  They describe the food as classic Berlin food with a new twist. We tried the wiener
  schnitzel and the steak tartare, while the food was good it wasn't great, and with
  the prices I was expecting amazing food.

  While it is not a bad place to go, I would not travel to go there specifically, however
  if you find yourself in the neighborhood starving, it might be not be a bad a idea
  to try their schnitzel.
