  Where to go for lunch when you are stuck in the touristy parts of
  the city?  That was my problem: some relatives where visiting and we
  were walking around Berlin Friedrichstra√üe, one of the most touristy
  areas in Berlin, where you can find some of the poshiest galleries
  or shops.  Eventually we found this restaurant, just in front of the
  Ritter Sport shop---which, by the way, is worth a visit on its own:
  you can create your own chocolate!

  They describe the food as classic Berlin food with a new twist. We
  tried the *wiener Schnitzel* and the *steak tartare*.  While the
  food was good it wasn't as amazing as you would expect from the
  price.

  While it's not a bad place to go to, I would not travel to go there
  specifically.  However if you find yourself starving in the
  neighborhood, it might be not be a bad a idea to try their
  *Schnitzel*.
