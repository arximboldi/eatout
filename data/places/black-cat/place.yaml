title: The Black Burger
description: |
   We heard about this place because of its _instagramable_ burgers.
   They are beautiful and once you see a great picture of them, its
   hard not to want one.

   The place is charming and comfortable, they inmediately greeted us
   with enthusiasm and were really attentive. We went for a *Sweet
   Cat* burger and a meaty Bloody Mary that was definitely worth it.
   The burger was decent, although I admit that it looks better than
   it tastes. The combination was good but the quality of the meat did
   not rise over the high bar that other venues have set in Berlin.

   I would definitely recommend the place---it's perfect to go with
   friends and have a nice dinner---but maybe you will find a better
   burger elsewhere if you are really into burgers.
