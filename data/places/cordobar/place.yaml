   We had read so many amazing reviews about this wine bar in mitte, that we couldn't
   wait to try it. Reading throw the tapas menu just makes your mounth water,
   and the wine list is insane, although some of the prices there also (it can get up to
   999€).

   We started with the **bread & butter**, which is a delicate whipped butter with
   a soft texture mixed with rote bete. This is something everyone should try, it
   has nothing to do with the normal butter, it tastes more like a creamy delight.
   Followed by **frozen hamachi ceviche**, a must-try (if the menu doesn't change
   before you go). The **artichoke with liquorice** is defenitely different than
   what I expected, but it's was worth a try. We didn't love the three tortelini
   soup- for 13€. We finished with a **chocolate cake** with maracuja cream,
   always a great choice.

   Although the stuff seemed nice, we didn't like the behaviour of the waiter.
   At first he was almost forcing us to order some dishes - it is nice to
   have some recommendations but this was too much, and also suggesting around
   dishes 3-4 for person, which turned out to be more than necessary (5 for two
   were enough for us). He also made a miskate and brought us sparkling water
   instead of still, when we told him about it he seemed bothered about it and
   took us a couple of arguments with him to correct the mistake.

   Althougt we liked the place, I would rather recommend
   [**industry standard**](place/industry-standard).
